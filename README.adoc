# Syslog Javascript Client

## RLO_08

Client Library written in Javascript to send messages to a Syslog server

### Generate the Syslog messages

```javascript
let message = new SyslogMessage.Builder()
        .withAppName('bulk-data-sorted')
        //.withTimestamp(timestamp) // In case if the timestamp disabled, it will go with system timestamp.
        .withHostname('iris.teragrep.com')
        .withFacility(Facility.LOCAL0)
        .withSeverity(Severity.INFORMATIONAL)
        .withProcId('8740')
        .withMsgId('ID47')
        .withMsg('Don’t test it as NÀSÀ¶¶ Àpplication') // Fixed: Problem with handling utf8 characters.
        .withSDElement(new SDElement("exampleSDID@32473", new SDParam("iut", "3"), new SDParam("eventSource", "Àpplication"))) //Updated support for UTF-8
